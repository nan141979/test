							<h3>Buy and Hold <strong>FullWallet (FW)</strong> and you will automatically get more in your wallet.
								No need to farm, stake or claim.</h3>

							<p>


								Each trade also automatically adds liquidity on Pancakeswap leading to an ever-increasing
								price floor of <strong>FullWallet</strong>. This
								means that even if every single <strong>FullWallet</strong> holder sells, the price will not
								go to zero.

											Though the core development team is always working on <strong>FullWallet</strong>
											it is the community who can guarantee its success. On Telegram,
											Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit and other social media channels, our awesome

											Our tokenomics incentivize holding. We like to say "we pay you to hold". 2% of
											each transaction goes instantly and gaslessly
											to the <strong>FullWallet</strong> holders, proportional to their holdings.

											Immediately after launch we burned more than 50% of the total supply of <strong>FullWallet</strong>
											and sent it to a dead wallet. Because
											the dead wallet is also a holder, it also gets proportional transaction rewards.
											But since nobody has access to that wallet, those
											<strong>SAFEAMRS</strong> tokens are retired from circulation (effectively
											burned). The burn happens on every transaction and accelerates
											as the black hole gets bigger...forever!
