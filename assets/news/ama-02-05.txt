Hello all! 😘

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:01]
Welcome everyone to the weekly SafeMars/SafeEarth AMA, which we're having for the first time in the SafeEarth TG 😜

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:02]
I'll start as usual with some updates about what we've been working on, then share some news, some info about competitions and finally we'll unmute and do some live AMA questions.

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:02]
Here we go...

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:03]
First of all the status: SafeMars currently has almost 370.000 holders 🤯 while SafeEarth has reached 6.300 🎉

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:03]
Both of these show good and steady growth and for that we thank everyone trusting us!

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:05]
As always, I'm not going to mention anything about the price except this: please keep in mind we CANNOT control the market. So we can't influence the price directly. 

You might've noticed we have a zero fud policy: anyone asking "why dump", "wen moon" type of questions is muted. Everyone fudding is banned. We will continue this as sadly a lot of discussion in both mars and earth groups is around price. To be clear, you can join https://t.me/safemarsearthpricetalk to talk about price, we'd like to keep the main channels focused on product.

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:05]
What we CAN control is the work we do on the projects and here you have our promise we'll continue working our butts off to move them forward.

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:05]
So...what happened in 1 week since the last AMA, let's see

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:07]
We had some more AMAs in communities numbering more than 100k users in total: Satoshi Club and Crypto Talkz. I think they went well.

We were supposed to have two more: BullCrypto (was canceled mysteriously) and Gate.Io (was delayed). 

We'll continue to spread awareness as much as we can, but of course you can ask ANYTHING in our channels any time. You don't need to wait for AMAs. Of course if you ask "why dump" => mute 😊

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:07]
We also listed SafeMars on another exchange: BitMart 🎉

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:09]
The listing went mostly smoothly, with some minor hiccups which are now solved. SafeMars is now listed on:
- WhiteBit
- Gate.io
- Bkex
- BitMart
- PancakeSwap
- Julswap
- Marswap 😊

Not bad if you ask me 👍

Unfortunately the listing of SafeEarth was delayed due to technical internal reasons of BitMart. They are working on fixing them and we hope we'll be able to list soon. Stay tuned for announcements.

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:11]
We also announced last time we're working on a native wallet application for SafeMars/SafeEarth. Work is progressing smoothly on it, but there's still quite a bit to be done. We'll keep you updated on progress. For now, quick preview 😜

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:12]
(uploading... 😅)

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:13]
That's it! Not much to see atm, most of the work was done behind the scenes. UI updates coming soon, stay tuned.

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:13]

in the meantime someone just DMed me this 🤷‍♀️

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:14]
Next up...I'm not sure if you noticed, but please click this link: https://www.safemarscrypto.com/

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:14]
😜

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:14]
That's right, our refreshed SafeMars website is live 🎉

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:16]
We restyled it to be more in line with the clean style of the SafeEarth website, plus added some tweaks.

The statistics are down atm, we know, will be fixed.

Marswap is still front and center, allowing anyone to easily buy SafeMars.

Also, if you have any suggestions about what to add to the FAQ section, or otherwise on the website, please do let us know.

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:17]
We are also working on updating the SafeEarth website with the statistics, stay tuned...

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:17]
Speaking of SafeEarth...

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:19]
I'm happy to report that our next donation round will be AT LEAST 40 ETH, $118 000 at the current rate! By the time we make it, most likely more!

It will be our biggest donation yet 🎉 🎉 🎉  It will bring the total donated to over $300 000

If you have any suggestions for charities, please do let us know. 

We are humbled and extremely happy to be able to donate so much and it's only thanks to you guys! 😍

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:20]
Of course, since the donation fund grew, also the marketing funds grew, so we currently have a FAT marketing wallet 😊. We're executing our marketing plan on multiple fronts and we're gonna be expanding it BIG TIME! More updates on that later...

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:20]
Also on the topic of SafeEarth...

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:21]
...i'm happy to announce that just before the AMA we burned 1 trillion tokens fron the dev wallet 🔥🔥🔥

https://etherscan.io/tx/0x05d97b49c018d20c287d79f07bf9b42bf4d8f1a2e09ffa08ee73580ff04eeb5c

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:21]
It's something the community asked for and we heard you! We're not committing to a concrete burn schedule, but we'll surprise you with more burns for sure 😜

Joy, [02.05.21 20:22]
🔥🔥🔥

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:23]
Next up, I'd like to announce the winners of the Strong Holders Contest we started 2 weeks ago: https://twitter.com/safemartians/status/1383872336760238082

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:23]
1 Strong Holder of SafeMars and 1 Strong Holder of SafeEarth get $1k in tokens each

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:24]
For SafeMars the winner is: @ForeverHero7 (twitter handle), already sent him his prize 🥇

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:26]
For SafeEarth...it's a bit trickier: we chose one winner and turns out he sold his SafeMars yesterday 😂 Sadly there is no prize for Weak Holder 🤷‍♀️

Since we only found this out 30 minutes ago, it was too short a time to choose another winner. So here's what we'll do. If anyone thinks they qualify (see rules in the tweet above) just QUOTE RETWEET that tweet and use the hashtag #SafeEarthStrongHolder. We'll pick a random winner by tomorrow this time 😜

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:27]
Ok, next up, I'd like to share with you an idea we've been talking about...

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:28]
We currently have 1% of the SafeEarth transactions going to our marketing fund. This is great and it's not a small amount, however...

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:28]
...many in the community raised the point it's unfair that such a mechanism doesn't exist for SafeMars as well...
...and also, although it's a good amount, it's not a GREAT amount and we need GREAT to take both mars and earth to the next level

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:29]
So we've been thinking how to improve this...

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:29]
...and came up with the idea to potentially also redirect 1% of each SafeMars transaction!

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:31]
We're still investigating exactly how to do that and we'll come with an update once we find a solution. If we find a good solution, we will put up a vote for the community to decide.

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:31]
Stay tuned for more updates on this topic 😜

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:32]
And think whether it's something you would support...

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:32]
As usual, we don't promise things we can't deliver, so I won't say more on the topic until we're 100% sure it can be done, what it means (in numbers) and how we could use it.

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:33]
But imagine... 🤯

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:33]
Alright, next up, some marketing updates as a lot of you have been asking 😜

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:33]
Ken, take it away sir 💪

Ken SafeEarth - SafeMars CEO, [02.05.21 20:33]
Hello everyone, its great to be able to provide feedback to the community on a weekly basis to inform you of all that's going on behind the curtains.

Ken SafeEarth - SafeMars CEO, [02.05.21 20:34]
I wanted to give you a small marketing update. We are in contact with large agencies who specialize in crypto advertising and part of the Marketing fund will be used to bring in a much wider team to contribute push us forward and reach the masses for both SafeMars and SafEarth.

Ken SafeEarth - SafeMars CEO, [02.05.21 20:35]
Unfortunately, it takes some time to get these contracts and budgets finalized and as I'm sure you are aware these agencies only deal in regular business hours and Crypto never sleeps. Outside of that, we are pushing hard with ads influencers, and various other means of advertising around the clock.

Ken SafeEarth - SafeMars CEO, [02.05.21 20:37]
As we expand our marketing team with the new agencies we are bringing on board, our manpower and the amount of tasks  and work will increase greatly. Having an extra 50 pair of hands to Shill bounce ideas who have a lot of experience in pushing projects such as ours will be of a great advantage to us.

Ken SafeEarth - SafeMars CEO, [02.05.21 20:38]
I get asked regularly In what direction I see SafeMars going and what our future holds. We are currently exploring various ventures to infiltrate the Asian market. Korea and the middle East in additional others, whilst things are not set in stone these routes we are persuing are not crossed in a day or two, unfortunately, they take time and patience, determination, and hard work. But I know we will get there, so please bear with us Martians :)

Ken SafeEarth - SafeMars CEO, [02.05.21 20:39]
Likewise, For SafeEarth, Our community has achieved great things since its launch. We now have an extra 40 ETH ($119,894 est.) which we will be donating again soon :) But beyond that, I wanted to share our vision for SafeEarth. We are aiming towards making SafeEarth its own Legal Registered Charity. A respected and organized community-driven charity powered by the Earth Fund. Using the Earth Fund to complete our own achievements and send community members on SafeEarth Missions around the world to help developing countries and communities, engaging with those that need us the most on a private and personal level.

Ken SafeEarth - SafeMars CEO, [02.05.21 20:40]
Whilst to some of you this may seem like a long way away, believe you me its a lot closer than you think. Imagine what we could achieve in months to come if in 1 month and a few days since launch we have already raised slightly over $300k!!!

Ken SafeEarth - SafeMars CEO, [02.05.21 20:40]
Of course, we will still push on with CEX listings, pushing SafeEarth in the crypto community and our wider marketing campaign. But being accepted in the Charity sector and acceptance by the masses will be our biggest achievement yet which will also bring in more investors, and it's just around the corner.

Ken SafeEarth - SafeMars CEO, [02.05.21 20:40]
Thank you all for being part of these amazing communities we couldn't do this without each and every one of you and you will be seeing some big changes happening! I remind you all once again that the team is here and working round the clock and we appreciate your feedback. We will be providing forms so that you can send us your thoughts and recommendations directly!.  from Earth to Mars we will make crypto history.  ❤️❤️❤️❤️

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:41]
Awesome stuff!

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:41]
Thank you Ken!

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:41]
I also have one marketing sneak peak on behalf of Batman who couldn't be here

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:42]
We're continuing to pursue our collaboration with the electronic dance music scene and there we're looking to:
1. Organize live events, Mars/Earth themed, where our tokens would  actually have utility for the holders 😜
2. Have some BIG names from the scene invest (i.e. BUY) Mars/earth and promote it heavily

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:42]
We'll post more details as we have them 😜

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:43]
Ok, next up, some more cool stuff I'll let Jesus describe

Jesus, [02.05.21 20:43]

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:53]
Alright, before we unmute and take live questions...I wrote before about the 1% tax redirection. I want to give you briefly one more sneak peak how this will go, after the AMA:
1. I will publish a medium article how the mechanism will work
2. We'll put up a vote for everyone to vote on whether we do it or not.
3. If the community decides we do it, we're confident it will give us enough funds to start an AWESOME competition...

...which will involve Elon Must and automobiles, if you catch my drift 😜

Stay tuned, because if we pull this off, it will be MASSIVE!

What's more, if we pull this off, we'll be able to do it REPEATEDLY...FOREVER! 🤯




Safemars ArmyGeneral, [02.05.21 20:57]
Awesome guys.... And are you guys working on how to Stake safeEarth, I don't know actually to put it



The Martian, [02.05.21 20:57]
[In reply to Safemars ArmyGeneral]
Yes, it's on our list.


Franck Shades, [02.05.21 20:57]
SafeEarth will be a legally registered entity. Great move guys


Ken SafeEarth - SafeMars CEO, [02.05.21 21:00]
We are working towards that Goal :) it will take some time and many legal issues to overcome bu we will get there


 

Nik Had G, [02.05.21 20:57]
can safeearth migrate to bnb instead of eth? When can we expect a Youtube live ama? that would be great

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:58]
[In reply to Nik Had G]
We won't migrate because we have SafeMars on BSC.




Bogard David Blancarte, [02.05.21 20:58]
Hello, where i can buy it?

The Martian, [02.05.21 20:58]

safeearth.app


 
Mehmet Sandıkcı, [02.05.21 20:58]
Dear team,
Thanks for all explanation. SafeEarth project is really exciting project in crypto world in ky opinion. I want to ask if %1 charity piece will be increased in future? Also are you thinking about to donate health sector?


The Martian, [02.05.21 20:58]
[In reply to Mehmet Sandıkcı]
We haven't thought about increasing the 1%. If you have any suggestions for donations to the health sector, please let us know.



Caroline, [02.05.21 20:58]
Good info about where the projects are going! Are we able to get video AMAs next time?

Ken SafeEarth - SafeMars CEO, [02.05.21 21:00]
We will be doing future AMAs by video and I personally will be streaming and answering any questions you may have. Its in the works, thank you :)


 


Fahd, [02.05.21 21:00]
Have you guys applied to Bittrex?

The Martian, [02.05.21 21:00]
[In reply to Fahd]
We haven't...yet


Kevin, [02.05.21 21:00]
@TheCryptoMartian please can we look for a charity were if we help they can also push us out there to the world. We have a great mission but low audience

Ken SafeEarth - SafeMars CEO, [02.05.21 21:00]
[In reply to Kevin]
we will be adding a form to the website shortly which you can fill in and give us your ideas on charities to donate too :)


 
Lívia Terra, [02.05.21 21:01]
When its gonna be the next donation?


Franck Shades, [02.05.21 21:01]
I think a donation to India at this moment in time because of the Covid there would be a great move

The Martian, [02.05.21 21:01]
[In reply to Franck Shades]
True!


Jake, [02.05.21 21:02]
[In reply to Negative Horo]
Great news Team. Just a question here- is safe wallet a final name? Asking becouse there one already existing in play store Android. Or that yours/ours?


The Martian, [02.05.21 21:02]
[In reply to Jake]
It's not final, feel free to suggest another 😜


celalworld, [02.05.21 21:02]
You managed to enter 4 exchange in April. What is your goal for May?



We don't really count them in numbers, but importance. Our goal is to continue to get listed on bigger and bigger exchanges.
